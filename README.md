Mpesa is one of the most convenient ways people make transactions in Kenya.  MPESA has come a long way from just sending and receiving the money to making payments to businesses.  With the rapid transformation in the e-commerce industry, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting businesses across the world, businesses have moved online. You can now integrate MPESA into your online business for faster transactions with your customers. In this article, we are going to learn how to do the MPESA STK Push API using PHP.

Daraja API is an Application Programming Interface that creates a bridge for payment integration to web and mobile apps. In your web app, you can create a button that when a user clicks, they can initiate payment.


For example, a web application provides a button that the user clicks to send a request to Safaricom Daraja; upon receiving the request, Daraja sends an STK push which contains the amount to be deducted from the Mpesa wallet.

The user is then prompted to enter their PIN. Once the user enters the PIN, the transaction is processed immediately
